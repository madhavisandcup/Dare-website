                <p>Despite making up more than half of Nigeria’s population, the youth remain largely underrepresented in political leadership and decision-making. This article explores why bridging this generational gap is vital for a progressive, accountable, and inclusive democracy — and how young Nigerians are stepping up, supported by leaders like Oluwadare.</p>
                <p>
                    With over 70% of Nigerians under the age of 30, the youth are not just the future they are the present. Yet, the corridors of power are still dominated by older generations. This imbalance creates a disconnect between policy and the lived realities of millions of young Nigerians.</p>

                    Recognizing this critical need, Oluwadare has launched mentorship programs, opened local political forums for youth, and prioritized education and digital literacy in his policy framework. His work seeks not just to speak to youth but to bring them directly into the decision-making process.
                    5. What Inclusion Really Looks Like
                    Youth inclusion isn’t just about numbers — it’s about trust, accountability, and shared governance. It’s about building systems where young voices shape the laws that impact them.</p>
